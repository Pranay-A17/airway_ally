Your app is already built for web! Share the web version with friends:

1. **Deploy to Firebase Hosting (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Install Firebase CLI
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   
   # Login to Firebase
   firebase login
   
   # Initialize hosting
   firebase init hosting
   # Choose your project: airway-ally
   # Public directory: build/web
   # Configure as SPA: Yes
   
   # Deploy
   firebase deploy
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify (Super Easy)**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag and drop the `build/web` folder
   - Get a shareable URL instantly

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   - Push your code to GitHub
   - Enable Pages in repository settings
   - Set source to `build/web` folder

### üì± **Option 2: Mobile Apps**

   ```
